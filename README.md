# Welcome to my Fire Service Analytics repo!

## Motivation

As a firefighter for the City of Toronto with a passion for data analytics, I was inspired to combine my expertise in both fields to uncover valuable insights. By analyzing fire incident data, I aim to contribute to better fire safety measures and more efficient resource allocation, ultimately helping to save lives and preserve property.

## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from the City of Toronto's open data portal, specifically from the Toronto Fire Services. The datasets include:
- **Basic Incident Details (2021):** This dataset includes information on all incidents responded to by TFS in 2022, not just fires. It contains details such as incident types, alarm level, and general locations.
- **Fire Incidents Data (2011-2022):** Detailed records of fire incidents, including incident dates, locations, alarm levels, and estimated dollar losses.
- **TFS Run Areas:** Geospatial data representing the areas covered by different fire stations.

## Project Description

2021 TFS Incident Frequency: These heatmaps visualize all incidents responded to by TFS in 2021, organized by day of the week, month, and hour.

2022 TFS Major Fire Incidents: This visualization highlights TFS Run Areas with incident counts for fires with alarm levels 1 and higher in 2022. It provides insights into the distribution and frequency of major fire incidents across different areas in Toronto.

TFS Fire Damage Costs Map: This map visualizes the total estimated dollar loss from fire damage, organized by fire station run area in Toronto from January 2011 to December 2022. Created using the GeoPandas library in Python, this map provides a clear representation of the financial impact of fires on various neighborhoods.

2022 False Alarm Incidents: This map visualizes how many false alarms Toronto Fire Services responded to in the year 2022. Incidents such as these include accidental activations, fireworks with no fire, and other non-emergencies. This map does not include the occurence of false alarm medical incidents.
